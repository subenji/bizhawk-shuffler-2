# Bizhawk Shuffler 2

BizHawk 2.6.3 changed how client.openrom() functions, allowing scripts to continue executing and not reload each time. As Authorblues' version had many hacks to account for that behaviour, some rewrites were necessary to fix compatibility.

I chose to update the script as newer versions of BizHawk improved N64 and DS emulation performance in particular.
