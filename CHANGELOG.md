## CHANGELOG
* Various fixes to control flow to make script work with BizHawks' 2.6.3+ handling of client.openrom
* added completed-games-num.txt output for stream overlay labelling
* changed handling of muting/unmuting audio on game swap as rapid swapping could corrupt an internal variable and leave emulation muted regardless of initial state
* Updated incompatible version output
